# [CodeWars Challenges](https://github.com/errobicheau/CodeWars)
A repisority filled with CodeWars challenges (katas) and their solutions. 7+ solutions are pushed each week.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** ![JAVASCRIPT BADGE](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=|&message=JAVASCRIPT&color=3c7f5d&style=plastic&logo=javascript)

Part of my daily code practice routine includes solving at least one CodeWars kata!

## Optimizations

In practice, I cosistently refactor and optimize my code keeping both efficiency and readability in mind.  

## Lessons Learned:

The largest takeaway from CodeWars challeneges has been managing frustration through problem solving in programming- I have learned to break each problem down into much more manageable pieces and make a worthwhile attempt to solve as much of each kata as possible before seeking additional help.
