## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** JavaScript

Part of my daily code practice routine includes solving at least one CodeWars kata!

## Optimizations

In practice, I cosistently refactor and optimize my code keeping both efficiency and readability in mind.  

## Lessons Learned:

The largest takeaway from CodeWars challeneges has been managing frustration through problem solving in programming- It's often difficult to things exactly right the first time around, so breaking down the question into much more manageable pieces and pushing to solve as much of the kata as possible before seeking further help if necessary is essential for growth.
